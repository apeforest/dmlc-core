        Parameters
        ----------
        key : str, or int
            The key.

        value : NDArray
            The value corresponding to the key to broadcast. If `out` is not specified,
            `value` NDArray will be updated in-place.

        out : NDArray, list of NDArray
            Output tensor that receives value broadcasted from root process
            If not specified, output will be written to `value`

            The priority of the operation.
            Higher priority operations are likely to be executed before other actions.

        """ Performs allreduce on a single tensor or a list of tensor objects

        This function performs in-place summation of the input tensor over all the processes.

        The name `pushpull` is a generic term. In Horovod, its action is implemented via
        ring allreduce. Each operation is identified by the 'key'; if `key` is not provided, an
        incremented auto-generated name is used. The tensor type and shape must be
        the same on all processes for a given name. The reduction will not start until all processes
        are ready to send and receive the tensor.

        Parameters
        ----------
        key : str, int, or sequence of str or int
            Keys used to uniquely tag an operation.

        value : NDArray
            Tensor value on one process to be summed. If `out` is not specified, the `value` will
            be modified in-place

        out: NDArray
            Output tensor after allreduce. If not specified, the input tensor `value` will be
            modified in-place.

        priority : int, optional
            The priority of the operation.
            Higher priority operations are likely to be executed before other actions.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> # perform in-place allreduce on tensor a
